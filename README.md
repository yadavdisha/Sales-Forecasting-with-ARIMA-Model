# 🛒 Sales Forecasting with ARIMA Model
Welcome to my Sales Forecasting project! This repository contains a time series analysis and forecasting solution using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The goal is to predict future sales based on historical data.


# 📊 Project Overview
In this project, I used sales data from multiple product lines and regions to build a reliable forecasting model that can predict quarterly sales. The data was cleaned and pre-processed to remove inconsistencies, and an ARIMA model was applied to capture trends and seasonality.

# Dataset
The dataset includes detailed records of:

Total Sales Value
Quantity Ordered
Product Line
Geographic Territories
Yearly and Quarterly Sales Performance
Key Features:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Removed noise and handled missing values to ensure data quality.
ARIMA Model Implementation: Applied an ARIMA model to forecast sales over the upcoming quarters.
Visualization: Included detailed visualizations like line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts to provide insights into sales trends.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python: For data analysis and model building
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and processing
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
Statsmodels: ARIMA model implementation
Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards

# 🚀 Results:
Forecasted future sales for different product lines, with accuracy measured against historical data.
Identified key trends in sales, including seasonality and product popularity across different territories.
# 📈 Visualizations
The project includes a comprehensive Tableau  dashboard that visualizes:

Total Sales
Total Profit
Quantity Ordered Per Product
Sales Distribution by Region
